<h3>
This is my favorite Lentil soup. It's very simple,<br>
and I've cobbled it together by trying some other recipes<br>
and then well, leaving stuff out. It is very, very simple,<br>
but it is also one of my favorite foods ever. Here are the ingredients:<br>

<h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2>
<p>Simple to do. Sweat the veggies over low heat with a little kosher salt.<br> 
When the onion is translucent, add lentils and stir. Cook them with the <br>
veggies for a couple minutes. Add tomatoes, water, cumin, and bay leaves. <br>
Bring to a boil. Simmer covered for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hour. Add the vinegar <br>
and thyme, cook for another minute or two. Add salt to taste.</p>

<p>I like my lentil soup this way, without too many herbs or any chicken broth.<br>
Recipes that call for those things are nice enough, but I like the brightness<br>
and mild acidity the soup has this way. I think it complements the earthy flavor<br>
of the lentils and the mirepoix.</p>

<h2><strong>Important reminders and tips:</h2></strong><br>
- Wash your lentils. And I did find a stone once, so keep an eye out.
<p>
- I like to use red wine vinegar in this, but I have used apple cider vinegar in a pinch, <br>
and I'm sure other vinegars could be fun. I mean, not white distilled of course. That stuff<br> 
is for cleaning the coffee pot and disinfecting the cutting board, IMHO.</p>
<p>
- Salt is key. I just made a batch of this and had to adjust the salt a couple times. <br>
The flavor is subtle so you need to use enough to bring it out, but if you use to much<br>
you'll overpower it. When I eat alone, I add salt in the bowl until it tastes about right.<br>
I think Kosher salt may do a noticeably better job here. Thanks to Carlo who got me paying<br>
more attention to my salt after a conversation we had awhile ago.</p>
